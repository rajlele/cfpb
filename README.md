To Run my code you need apache spark running on linux environment.

I usually try my code in REPL before I packaged them. I had some difficulties with data in complaint csv file. There were some records in Narrative field giving some issue with splitting the records from CSV to some sort of RDD array. 

Eventually when I took small sample of data everything was working ok. 

Header information was removed for simplicity. Also file was reduced to small size due to data issues in Narrative field. Further analysis of data is needed.
